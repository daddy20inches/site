	<h1>Naruto vs Dragon ball z</h1>

<p>We all know the fact that, Goku in his Mastered Ultra Instict form is basically a God or possibly stronger than GOD of destruction in the Universe. So lets compare both Naruto and Goku
</p><p>Naruto basically has 5 forms they are base form, Sennin Mode, Kurama cloak mode, Sennin+Kurama Cloak mode and lastly Six Path Sage mode+Kurama Cloak mode. His strengths are that he can perform Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu, Odona Rasengan, Rasen-Shuriken. These are his mastered and signature moves. His Martial arts is almost as good as Migto Gai’s, but still he is the strongest person so far in Naruto series. By the end of Naruto Shippuden this is his final form</p>

<p>Then there is God like being, whom even God of Destruction acknowledges and probably got a little scared when he achieved Mastered Ultra Instinct form, i.e., Son-Goku. Basically he is an alien who was sent to Earth before Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta. Now Goku here has 8 forms they are Base form, SSJ1, SSJ2, SSJ3, SSJGod, SSJGod Blue, Ultra Instinct mode and lastly Mastered Ultra instinct. Now Goku’s Mastered UI form here has literally scared the crap out of almost all the Gods of Destruction. His strengths are his Martial Arts, Spirit Bomb and finally the very famous Ka-me-ha-me-ha wave.</p>

<p>Now considering their Martial arts skills, both are almost equal, but Goku has the upperhand because of his stronger physical strength (no doubt after watching him fight Jiren) and Narutos speed is no match to that of Gokus we all know that. Then there is Spirit bomb the strongest attack of Gokus which helped them wipe out Kid Buu into dust</p><p> So there is no argument that Narutos Rasen-Shuriken even stands a chance infront of Spirit Bomb. Lastly, their famous attacks Rasengan and Ka-e-ha-me-ha. Both are intensely strong, but the thing is Rasengan cannot be thrown according to Manga, so Ka-me-ha-me-ha can easily destroy Naruto and his Rasengan without Goku even moving from his place, because it can be beamed out for longer distances as far as we know.</p>

<p>Now if we see the strengths of their signature moves. I guess with Naruto and his Kurama cloak+Six path sage mode, the maximum amount of destruction he can create is that he could destroy a village like Konohangakure or something like that, but when Goku uses his Spirit Bomb he can literally destroy a whole nation or even entire Earth with that amount of intense energy bomb.</p>

<p>So you can see Goku is definitely far more superior than Naruto, may it be strength, speed or physical flexibility. So. definitely Goku wins with a huge margin.
Let’s assume that somehow Narutos final kurama+ Six Sage path reaches Gokus strength when he is in SSJ2 (lets say). But Gokus SSJ3 and above forms are far more intense and superior than SSJ2. Although I am a huge Naruto series’ fan, I’d have to say Naruto isn’t even as strong as Piccolo in his current form in DB Super.</p>
