	<h1>one piece vs dragon ball z</h1>
</div>
<p>Luffy is very Physically strong. He can pick up Boulders with no problem and is able to Push two Sky scrapers apart, destroying them. Luffy can also Lift creatures that are many Tons and throw them like their paper weights. I would say that Physically Goku and Luffy are about the same. With Goku having a little edge going into SS2 and SS3 mode</p>

<p>But Luffy is a Stamina Freak, I would say that Luffy can fight for a week straight, without stopping. Just how his Older Brother, Fire Fist Ace, can do that too. I would have to say that Luffy has more Stamina that Goku.</p>

<p>Luffy is wicked fast though. Goku is fast for travailing purposes, and has does have the instant transmission which moves him at the speed of light, But he rarely uses it in fights and it takes a lot of energy. But Luffy can move up to speeds faster then Lighting. Also, Luffies attacks in his Gear Second mode reach speeds over Mach 2</p>

<p>So Fast that u can almost never see the attack go though, not even the slipstream. Also all these attacks that Luffy can to have unlimited reach because of his Rubber Rubber fruit. And this boosts hes defense a lot. Normal Punches don't hurt him nearly as much. So he can take a beating. 
But speed wise i would also go Luffy.</p>

<p>Of course, what sets Goku apart from most Anime characters is his destructive power. Luffy can send creatures 4 times the size of a mountain flying at his strongest so far. And he does have the Haki's which allow him to your predict every move, make an invisible armor around his body, and make anyone pass out on a whim, but they must be weak willed</p>

<p> On the other hand Goku can fire a beam into a planets core, destroying the core and thus destroy the planet itself. But Goku will never do this since he never has. Also has can fly which gives him a distinct advantage over Luffy. 
But Destructive power wise i would say Goku.

<p>I would also like to note something else, not really a game changer but Luffy has a large move set and can beat many people in a variety of different ways. all Goku has is the Turtle destruction wave (Kamehameha), spirit bomb, and dragon fist</p>
